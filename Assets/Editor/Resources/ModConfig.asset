  description: "This module asks you questions about some of the other modules on
    your bomb after you\u2019ve solved them. It requires you to remember or write
    down things that you used to solve those other modules.\r\n\r\n[url=http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Souvenir.pdf]Manual
    PDF[/url]\r\n[url=http://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Souvenir.html]Manual HTML[/url]\r\n\r\nSome
    of the things this module might ask about are listed below. For a complete list,
    please see the manual.\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]3D Maze:[/b] What were the floor
    markings and cardinal direction?\r\n[*][b]Bitmaps:[/b] How many white/black squares
    were in each quadrant?\r\n[*][b]Chess:[/b] What were the coordinates shown on
    the module?\r\n[*][b]Hexamaze:[/b] What color was the pawn?\r\n[*][b]Monsplode,
    Fight!:[/b] Which Monsplode and moves were displayed?\r\n[*][b]Mouse in the Maze:[/b]
    What color were the torus and the solution sphere?\r\n[*][b]Simon States:[/b]
    Which colors flashed?\r\n[*][b]The Bulb:[/b] What were the correct buttons that
    you pressed?\r\n[*][b]Two Bits:[/b] What were the three correct query responses?\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nIf
    you wish to see another module added, you can contribute development by submitting
    pull requests to the [url=https://github.com/Timwi/KtaneSouvenir]GitHub repository[/url],
    or finding a volunteer modder on the KTaNE Discord. Additions would generally
    be required to satisfy the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]No questions
    about things that can just be read off after the module is solved (e.g. the symbols
    in Astrology). However, Souvenir may hide this information on some modules, such
    as Adventure Game.\r\n[*]No questions about things that can be re-deduced by re-solving
    the module (e.g. offset in Caesar Cipher).\r\n[*]No questions about random things
    that aren\u2019t required for solving a module (e.g. initial red/green state in
    Connection Check).\r\n[*]No questions that could under any circumstances be impossible
    to answer. This includes things that are removed/reset when striking on a module.\r\n[*]No
    questions about modules that are part of an ongoing [manual challenge](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/FAQs.html#challenge).\r\n[*]Questions
    about [boss modules](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/FAQs.html#boss-module) are allowed
    as long as they satisfy the above guidelines. The boss modules should remain on
    Souvenir's ignore list.\r\n[*]Prefer questions that ask what was actually shown
    on the module rather than what the defuser had to input to solve it (e.g. prefer
    displayed digits over calculated digits in Forget Me Not).\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThe
    following vanilla modules are supported by Souvenir: The Button, Maze, Memory,
    Simon Says, Wire Sequence. These may be excluded using a setting in the ModSettings
    file. This file will be created the first time a Souvenir module is loaded on
    a bomb. After that, the mod settings may be edited using a text editor or the
    [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=801400247]Mod Selector[/url]
    tablet with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1366808675]Tweaks[/url]
    mod. Souvenir itself and other boss modules may also be excluded this way.\r\n\r\nThis
    module was forked at some point, but has returned here to its original author
    and maintainer. Many thanks to Andrio for taking care of Souvenir in the interim.
