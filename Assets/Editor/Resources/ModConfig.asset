  description: "This module asks you questions about some of the other modules on
    your bomb after you\u2019ve solved them. It requires you to remember or write
    down things that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be significant.\r\n\r\r\nSome of the
    things this module might ask you about are listed below. For a complete list,
    please see the manual.\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]3D Maze:[/b] floor markings, cardinal
    direction\r\n[*][b]Bitmaps:[/b] How many white/black squares were in each quadrant\r\n[*][b]Chess:[/b]
    What were the coordinates shown on the module?\n[*][b]Hexamaze:[/b] pawn color\r\n[*][b]Monsplode,
    Fight!:[/b] creature displayed and moves shown on buttons\r\n[*][b]Mouse in the
    Maze:[/b] color of the torus and the solution sphere\r\n[*][b]Simon States:[/b]
    which colors flashed\r\n[*][b]The Bulb:[/b] which buttons you pressed\n[*][b]Two
    Bits:[/b] the three correct query responses\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nIf you wish to see
    another module added, please leave a comment and/or send me a message. You can
    also contribute development by submitting pull requests to the [url=https://github.com/Timwi/KtaneSouvenir]source
    code[/url]. Additions would generally be required to satisfy the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]No
    questions about things that can just be read off after the module was solved (e.g.
    the symbols in Astrology)\r\n[*]No questions about things that can be re-deduced
    by re-solving the module (e.g. offset in Caesar Cipher)\r\n[*]No questions that
    could under any circumstances be impossible to answer\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[url=http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Souvenir.pdf]Manual
